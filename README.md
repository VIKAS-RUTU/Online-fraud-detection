# Online-fraud-detection
This project discusses on building a machine learning model to detect if an online transaction made is fraud or not.
I have mainly prioritized on classifying a fraudalent transaction as fraud (keeping the false negatives at the minimum), rather than looking at the overall accuracy of the model.
